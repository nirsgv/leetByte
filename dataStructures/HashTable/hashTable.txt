Recap
Hash tables are a collection of key-value pairs.
Hash tables can find values quickly given a key.
Hash tables can add new key-values quickly.
Hash tables store data in a large array, and work by hashing the keys.
A good hash should be fast, distribute keys uniformly, and be deterministic.
Separate chaining and linear probing are two strategies used to deal with two keys that hash to the same index.
