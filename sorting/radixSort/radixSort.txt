Radix sort is a special sorting algorithm that works on lists of numbers.
It never makes comparisons between elements.
It exploits the fact that information about the size of a number is encoded in the number of digits.

More digits means a bigger number!
If a number has four digits, it is larger than any two-digit number.

In order to implement radix sort, it's helpful to build a few helper functions first:
getDigit(num, place) - returns the digit in {num} at the given {place} value.
