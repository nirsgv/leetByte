So merge so it takes advantage of that fact it works by decomposing an array into smaller arrays.
We split up the larger array we're trying to sort into smaller sub arrays all the way down.
We keep doing it until we get to zero or one element arrays,
and then we merge them back together.

Time Complexity (best):
O(n log n)

Time Complexity (average):
O(n log n)

Time Complexity (worst):
O(n log n)

Space Complexity (worst):
O(n)
