Like merge sort, exploits the fact that arrays of 0 or 1 element are always sorted.
Works by selecting  one element (the pivot) and finding the index where the pivot should end up in the sorted array.
Once the pivot is positioned appropriately, quick sort can be applied on either side of the pivot.

quickSort pseudocode
Call the pivot helper on the array
when the helper returns to you the updated pivot index,
recursively call the pivot helper on the subarray to the left of that index,
and the subarray to the right of that index.
