reverse -
Write a recursive function called reverse which accepts a string and returns a new string in reverse.

isPalindrome -
Write a recursive function called isPalindrome which returns true if the string passed to it is
a palindrome (reads the same forward and backward).
Otherwise it returns false.

someRecursive -
Write a recursive function called someRecursive which accepts an array and a callback.
The function returns true if a single value in the array returns true when passed to the callback.
Otherwise it returns false.

flatten -
Write a recursive function called flatten which accepts an array of arrays and returns a new array
with all values flattened.

capitalizeWords -
Write a recursive function called capitalizeWords.
Given an array of words, return a new array containing each word capitalized.

nestedEvenSum -
Write a recursive function called nestedEvenSum.
Return the sum of all even numbers in an object which may contain nested objects.

stringifyNumbers -
Write a function called stringifyNumbers which takes in an object and finds all of the values which are numbers
and converts them to strings.
Recursion would be a great way to solve this!

collectStrings -
Write a function called collectStrings which accepts an object and returns an array of all the values in the object
that have a typeof string.
